NOTE:      Use only for Educational Purpose. Don't use this program to hack anyone.

I have collected some best login clones from the internet and combined them  with my idea to make a phishing program which can be effeciently used by anyone.<br>First Install  this repository and unzip it.
Then go to terminal and type following command to get started:

     python fishert.py --version

If this gives  version output, you have successfully installed it.
Type the following command to create a clone:
       
       python fishert.py --create <FLAG> <folder name to give>
       
 Replace the <FLAG> with respective flags:<br>
  
        Flag                  Description
        facebook-small        Facebook login clone page for smartphone victim.
        facebook-big          Facebook login clone page for PC victim.
        google                Google login clone page.
  
  More will certainly comein upcoming versions.
