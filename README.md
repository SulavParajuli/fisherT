NOTE:      Use only for Educational Purpose. Don't use this program to hack anyone.

I have collected some best login clones from the internet and combined them  with my idea to make a phishing program which can be effeciently used by anyone.<br>First Install  this repository and unzip it.
Then go to terminal and type following command to get started:

     python fishert.py --version

If this gives  version output, you have successfully installed it.
Type the following command to create a clone:
       
       python fishert.py --create <FLAG> <folder name to give>
       
 Replace the <FLAG> with respective flags:<br>
  
        Flag                  Description
        facebook-small        Facebook login clone page for smartphone victim.
        facebook-big          Facebook login clone page for PC victim.
        google                Google login clone page.
  After the phising is done successfully, the POST data i.e username and password gets stored in "<folder name to give>/cred/data.txt" where <folder name to give> is the folder name you gave while creating the clone.
  More will certainly come in upcoming versions.
